# RL_project

This repository contains the code for my thesis research. Under the supervision of Prof. Ofra Amir and Dr. Assaf Hallak, we developed methods to explain Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents to human users.

The code includes:

- Training RL agents using DQN algorithms
- Implementing a genetic algorithm to optimize the best subset of agent trajectories
- Creating short videos of agents in action
- Additional tools and scripts related to the research
